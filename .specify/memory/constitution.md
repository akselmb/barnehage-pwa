# Barnehage PWA Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature MUST be designed with security as the primary concern. Multi-tenant data isolation is mandatory - no cross-tenant data access allowed. All user inputs MUST be validated and sanitized. Authentication and authorization MUST be enforced at every endpoint. Security vulnerabilities MUST be treated as critical bugs requiring immediate fixes.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. End-to-end tests MUST be prioritized for critical user flows. Unit tests MUST cover all business logic. Test coverage MUST exceed 80% for production code. All tests MUST pass before any deployment.

### III. Feature Flag Implementation
All new features MUST be implemented behind feature flags. Feature flags MUST be configurable at runtime without code deployment. Feature flags MUST have clear rollback procedures. A/B testing capabilities MUST be built into the feature flag system. Feature flags MUST be documented with clear enable/disable criteria.

### IV. PWA Excellence Standards
The application MUST function as a native-like Progressive Web App. Offline functionality MUST be implemented for core features. Push notifications MUST work reliably across all supported platforms. App installation MUST be seamless on mobile devices. Performance MUST meet Core Web Vitals standards. Service worker MUST be properly configured for caching strategies.

### V. Simplified Multi-tenant Architecture
All kindergartens MUST share the same Supabase project and database schema. Each kindergarten MUST have a unique tenant_id for data isolation. Children MUST be linked to their kindergarten via tenant_id. Families MUST be connected to children through child_id relationships. The architecture MUST be designed to allow future migration to separate projects if needed. Row Level Security (RLS) MUST enforce tenant isolation at the database level.

### VI. Norwegian Language Priority
All user-facing content MUST be in Norwegian (Bokmål). Date/time formats MUST follow Norwegian conventions. Error messages MUST be user-friendly in Norwegian. Documentation MUST be available in both Norwegian.

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication MUST be available for administrators
- Role-based access control MUST be enforced at the API level
- Session management MUST use secure tokens with appropriate expiration
- Password policies MUST meet Norwegian security standards
- Account lockout MUST be implemented after failed login attempts

### Data Protection
- All data transmission MUST use HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- Sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest
- Personal data MUST comply with GDPR requirements
- Data retention policies MUST be clearly defined and implemented
- Audit logs MUST be maintained for all data access

### Infrastructure Security
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) MUST be enabled for all tables
- Database connections MUST use connection pooling
- API rate limiting MUST be implemented
- CORS policies MUST be restrictive
- Security headers MUST be properly configured

## PWA Standards

### Performance Requirements
- First Contentful Paint MUST be < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint MUST be < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift MUST be < 0.1
- First Input Delay MUST be < 100ms
- Time to Interactive MUST be < 3.5s

### Offline Capabilities
- Core content MUST be available offline
- Data synchronization MUST work when connectivity returns
- Offline indicators MUST be clearly visible to users
- Critical actions MUST be queued for when online

### Installation & Updates
- App MUST be installable on mobile devices
- Update mechanism MUST be seamless
- Version compatibility MUST be maintained
- Rollback capability MUST be available

## Simplified Multi-tenant Architecture

### Data Model Requirements
- **kindergartens** table MUST have unique tenant_id as primary key
- **children** table MUST reference kindergarten via tenant_id foreign key
- **families** table MUST be linked to children through child_id relationships
- **profiles** table MUST include tenant_id for user-tenant association
- All data queries MUST include tenant_id filtering via RLS policies

### Tenant Isolation Strategy
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies MUST prevent cross-tenant data access
- All API endpoints MUST validate tenant_id from authenticated user context
- Database views MUST be tenant-scoped where appropriate
- Backup and recovery procedures MUST maintain tenant data integrity

### Future Migration Path
- Database schema MUST be designed to support future project separation
- Tenant-specific data MUST be clearly identified and easily extractable
- Migration scripts MUST be prepared for potential future architecture changes
- No hardcoded single-project assumptions in application code

### Scalability Considerations
- Architecture MUST support 100+ kindergartens in single project
- Database indexing MUST be optimized for tenant_id-based queries
- Caching strategies MUST be tenant-aware
- Resource usage MUST be monitored per tenant

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode MUST be enabled
- ESLint rules MUST be enforced
- Code reviews MUST be mandatory for all changes
- Automated testing MUST run on every commit
- Code coverage MUST be reported

### Deployment Process
- Feature flags MUST be used for gradual rollouts
- Database migrations MUST be backward compatible
- Rollback procedures MUST be tested and documented
- Environment parity MUST be maintained
- Security scanning MUST be automated

### Documentation
- API documentation MUST be up-to-date
- Architecture decisions MUST be documented
- User guides MUST be available in Norwegian
- Developer onboarding MUST be streamlined

## Governance

All development MUST follow this constitution. Violations MUST be addressed immediately. Amendments require:
1. Documented rationale for change
2. Impact assessment on existing features
3. Migration plan for breaking changes
4. Approval from technical lead
5. Update to all dependent templates
